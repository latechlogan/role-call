# ARIA Role Call

A definitive, filterable reference of semantic HTML elements, their implicit ARIA roles, and allowed ARIA properties.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of ARIA Role Call is to provide front-end developers with a quick, definitive resource that maps standard semantic HTML elements to their W3C-defined ARIA roles and constraints.

This resource is essential for developers who need to understand the precise accessibility contract of an element, enabling:

- **Reliable Testing**: Using `getByRole` with confidence in tools like React Testing Library.
- **Valid ARIA Usage**: Knowing which role and `aria-*` attributes are valid for any given HTML element.

## Data Structure

The core value of this project is the comprehensive data pulled directly from the W3C ARIA in HTML Specification. Each entry includes:

| Field            | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `element`        | The HTML tag (e.g., `<a>`, `<button>`, `<li>`).                                    |
| `withConditions` | Any conditions that change the implicit role (e.g., "with href" for `<a>`).        |
| `implicitRole`   | The default ARIA role assigned by the browser (e.g., `link`, `button`).            |
| `allowedRoles`   | A list of explicit ARIA roles that can legally override the default role (if any). |
| `ariaAttributes` | A list of `aria-*` attributes that are permitted on this element.                  |
| `notes`          | Any special considerations or exceptions from the specification.                   |

## Features

- **Searchable/Filterable Interface**: Quickly search by element, role, or attribute.
- **Clear Role Mapping Table**: Visualize the element → `implicitRole` relationship.

## Data Reference

The data is meticulously compiled from the W3C's source of truth: [W3C ARIA in HTML Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/)
